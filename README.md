# Analisis of sort algorithms


## Data to analize:
	* Time to sort the algorithm.
	* Operations need to sort (Comparations &  Assigments).
	* Size of the array.

##  Data Strucuture:
	1- Class analyzer.
	2- Abstract class sort algorithm.
		* Class first algorithtm, (Shell-Sort).
		* Class first algorithtm, (Cocktail-Sort).
		* Class first algorithtm, (Merge-Sort).

## Steps to follow:
	1- Develop the program code.
	2- Take measures of the differents inputs.
	3- Analyze the data.
	4- Draw the conclusions of time and operation complexity.
