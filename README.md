# Analisis of sort algorithms


## Data to analize:
	* Time to sort the algorithm.
	* Operations need to sort (Comparations &  Assigments).
	* Size of the array.

##  Data Strucuture:
	1- Class analyzer, (Launcher.java).
	2- Class with the sort algorithms, (algorithms.SortAlgorithms.java).
    3- Class random array generator, (data.RandomArray).
    4- Class with the basic data to anlyze time complexity, (data.Data).

## Steps to follow:
	1- Develop the program code.
	2- Take measures of the differents inputs.
	3- Analyze the data.
	4- Draw the conclusions of time and operation complexity.
